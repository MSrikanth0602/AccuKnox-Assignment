Question1:
This means that when a signal is emitted, the execution of the current process pauses until all connected receivers have finished processing.
Code Snippet:
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver

def slow_receiver(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    # Simulate a long-running task
    import time
    time.sleep(5)
    print("Slow receiver finished")

post_save.connect(slow_receiver, sender=YourModel)


Explanation:
1.We connect the slow_receiver function to the post_save signal for a specific model (YourModel).
2.When an instance of YourModel is saved, the post_save signal is emitted.
3. The slow_receiver function is executed synchronously. This means that the current process will wait for 5 seconds before continuing.
