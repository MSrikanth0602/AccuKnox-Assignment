Question3:
Signals are executed after the transaction that triggered them has already committed. This means that any database operations performed within a signal handler will occur in a separate transaction.
Code Snippet:
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.db import transaction

@receiver(post_save, sender=YourModel)
def my_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    with transaction.atomic():
        # Database operations here
        # ...

Explanation:
1. The with transaction.atomic() block ensures that the database operations within the signal handler are executed in a separate transaction.
2.This isolation prevents issues like data consistency problems that might arise if the signal handler's operations were part of the original transaction.
